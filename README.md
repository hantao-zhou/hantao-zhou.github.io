# Personal Homepage

This site is a simple Next.js app styled with [Terminal CSS](https://terminalcss.xyz). The home page shows basic information and includes a button that opens a window using [WinBox.js](https://nextapps-de.github.io/winbox/).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The static site will be generated in the `out` directory, ready to be published on GitHub Pages.
